# Data Science Project: Predictive Ski Resort Ticket Price Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to my data science project showcasing my skills in predictive analytics and machine learning. The purpose of this project is to develop a pricing model for ski resort tickets based on a number of facilities boasted by resorts. This model will be used to provide guidance for the client's pricing and future facility investment plans.

This is the result of a guided capstone project for the Springboard Data Science program.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Wrangling and Analysis

In the `Notebooks` folder, the `02_data_wrangling.ipynb` notebook outlines the steps taken to clean and preprocess the data. Here, I removed erroneous data, added regional summary data, and gained understanding of the factors contributing to ticket price. The `03_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook performs a comprehensive exploration of the dataset.

### 2. Training and Modeling

The heart of the project lies in the next two notebooks. In the `04_preprocessing_and_training.ipynb` notebook, I experimented with various machine learning algorithms to build a robust predictive model for ticket prices. The `05_modeling.ipynb` notebook uses our model to gain insight into what the client's ideal ticket price should be, and how that might change under various scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Results

The model achieved a mean cross-validation error of less than $10, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting ticket price. Further details and visualizations can be found in the project notebooks.

Feel free to explore the code and notebooks to gain a deeper understanding of my data science and machine learning skills.
